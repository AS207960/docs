Please see each service's respective documentation for details about API availability. OAuth \u00b6 All our services use OAuth for authentication and UMA2 for authorization. The OAuth discovery document can be found here . This will give you all the required endpoints to perform OAuth against an account. Client registration \u00b6 To create and manage your OAuth clients please use the console here . Scopes \u00b6 Most actions are protected by requesting scopes at the point of authorization. The user will be asked to consent to your application having access to the scopes you've requested. When registering your client you'll need email us to tell us what scopes you want access to and to provide a reason for each scope. Service account \u00b6 Each client will get its own service account, using the client credentials grant type, for managing resources directly related to the client in question. Not much useful can be done with the service account though and most actions will require being authorized to access a user's account. Refresh tokens \u00b6 The tokens issued to clients are very short lived (on the order of minutes), which means your application will have to support refresh tokens to properly interact with our APIs. Personal Access Tokens \u00b6 If you only want to access your own account and don't want to use OAuth you can use use a personal access token to authenticate as your user and your user only. You can mint PATs in the OAuth console. When making requests with PATs you should pass them as follows; GET /api/resource/1 HTTP / 1.1 Host : example.glauca.digital Authorization : X-AS207960-PAT <your token> Making API requests \u00b6 API authorization \u00b6 When attempting to access one of our APIs authorization can be provided by the HTTP authorization header, as demonstrated below; GET /api/resource/1 HTTP / 1.1 Host : example.glauca.digital Authorization : Bearer <your token> Content type \u00b6 In general our APIs can accept data as a JSON body or as a form submission, and can return data as JSON or as HTML to be rendered to a user. Be sure to declare the appropriate Content-Type when talking to our APIs to ensure your request in understood correctly, as shown below; POST /api/resource/1 HTTP / 1.1 Host : example.glauca.digital Authorization : Bearer <your token> Content-Type : application/json; charset=utf-8 Accept : application/json { \"some\" : \"data\" } HTTP / 1.1 201 Created Content-Type : application/json; charset=utf-8 { \"some\" : \"data\" } Errors \u00b6 Errors are mostly communicated through HTTP status codes. Here's a quick summary of the ones you'll likely see. 200 OK - All is well. 201 Created - All is well, and something was created. 204 No content - All is well, and we have nothing else to say. 400 Bad request - Ew!

This process can be annoying and prone to minor errors even with the ever handy copy paste. CDS and CDNSKEY records allow for automatic setup, rollover, and removal of DNSSSEC delegation for a zone. These are identical copies of what the child zone wants in the parent, hence Child DS and Child DNSKEY. We will poll the nameservers of all domains every hour to detect these records and make any changes in the parent as requested by the records. For the sneaky techy deets we implement this according to RFC 7344 and RFC 8078 . HexDNS implements CDS and CDNSKEY, and this is on by default, so you won't have to do anything to get HexDNS to provision DNSSEC automatically with us or any other regstrar/registry. Format of child records \u00b6 Consider the following DS record in the parent zone: website.example. 3600 IN DS 61301 13 2 FB7DF3397DB9AEA62EB81423CA1BB229CCAE3590DCBB16CE46C04D62B48DFB91 When the DS record of the new KSK is ready to be published in the parent zone, the child can set the following record: website.example. 3600 IN CDS 45224 13 2 8A7BD58EF0CFA7FFD3813B28A288C69DE9D38D3B5FE71816E82AE26AF0615165 Once this has been picked up the new DS in the parent zone will be: website.example. 3600 IN DS 45224 13 2 8A7BD58EF0CFA7FFD3813B28A288C69DE9D38D3B5FE71816E82AE26AF0615165 A child zone can also signal to turn off DNSSEC by publishing a special CDS record with an algorithm of 0, as follows: website.example. 3600 IN CDS 0 0 0 00 The procedure is identical for CDNSKEY , but with the DS data swapped out for DNSKEY data. Some zones (notably .de) require to be sent DNSKEY data rather than DS data and compute the DS record themselves. For this reason it is advisable to publish both CDS and CDNSKEY and the appropriate one will be used. Criteria for acceptance into parent zone \u00b6 Before records are accepted into the parent zone a few criteria must be met. This are as follows: Every name server must respond on every listed IP address over TCP with identical CDS sets. If the zone is already signed with DNSSEC the CDS record set must be singed by the current published DS/DNSKEY record set. CDS/CDNSKEY must use a supported algorithm and digest type; algorithms: 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 0 digest types: 1, 2, 4, 0 The zone must validate with the new CDS set. Post acceptance \u00b6 Once we've received the request, validated, and successfully enacted upon it, we'll send you an email with a summary of what DS/DNSKEY records have been added/removed.","title":"Automatic DNSSEC provisioning"},{"location":"domains/cds/#automatic-dnssec-provisioning","text":"After you or your DNS operator has setup DNSSEC on the zone, DS records need to be inserted into the parent zone (.com, .net, etc) to complete the chain of trust from the ICANN root zone.

This tells other networks that your ASN will originate your prefix. The RIPE DB can be accessed at apps.db.ripe.net .

Here you can create objects which define your routing procedure etc, defined in a language called RPSL. The most important one to create is a route / route6 for your new ASN. This tells other networks that your ASN will originate your prefix. The RIPE DB can be accessed at apps.db.ripe.net .
