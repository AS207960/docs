Please see each service's respective documentation for details about API availability. OAuth \u00b6 All our services use OAuth for authentication and UMA2 for authorization. The OAuth discovery document can be found here . This will give you all the required endpoints to perform OAuth against an account. Client registration \u00b6 At the current time please contact us to register your OAuth client. We're working on a management console for clients, but until this is working all client management must be done manually. Scope whitelisting \u00b6 Most actions are protected by requesting scopes at the point authorization. The user will be asked to consent to your application having access to the scopes you've requested. When registering your client you'll need to tell us what scopes you want access to and to provide a reason for each scope. Service account \u00b6 Each client will get its own service account, using the client credentials grant type, for managing resources directly related to the client in question. Not much useful can be done with the service account though and most actions will require being authorized to access a user's account. Refresh tokens \u00b6 The tokens issued to clients are very short lived (on the order of minutes), which means your application will have to support refresh tokens to properly interact with our APIs. Making API requests \u00b6 API authorization \u00b6 When attempting to access one of our APIs authorization can be provided by the HTTP authorization header, as demonstrated below; GET /api/resource/1 HTTP / 1.1 Host : example.glauca.digital Authorization : Bearer <your token> Content type \u00b6 In general our APIs can accept data as a JSON body or as a form submission, and can return data as JSON or as HTML to be rendered to a user. Be sure to declare the appropriate Content-Type when talking to our APIs to ensure your request in understood correctly, as shown below; POST /api/resource/1 HTTP / 1.1 Host : example.glauca.digital Authorization : Bearer <your token> Content-Type : application/json; charset=utf-8 Accept : application/json { \"some\" : \"data\" } HTTP / 1.1 201 Created Content-Type : application/json; charset=utf-8 { \"some\" : \"data\" } Errors \u00b6 Errors are mostly communicated through HTTP status codes. Here's a quick summary of the ones you'll likely see. 200 OK - All is well. 201 Created - All is well, and something was created. 204 No content - All is well, and we have nothing else to say. 400 Bad request - Ew!
