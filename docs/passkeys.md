# Passkeys

Glauca now supports Passkeys to make your account more secure, and to make
logging in an easier process.

## What is a Passkey?

Passkeys are a new way to sign into apps and websites. Passkeys will let
you sign into Glauca the same way you unlock your phone or computer, with
a fingerprint, face, or your screen lock PIN.

Passkeys are a industry standard, and are designed to be more secure than
passwords. Your access to Glauca is cryptographically tied to your device,
removing the need for a password.

For more info about Passkeys and how they work, please visit the help page of your browser or device.

## How do I login with a Passkey?

When you sign into Glauca, you'll enter your username and then be prompted
to either use your Passkey, or to enter your password (if you have one configured).

If you choose to use your Passkey, that's it! You're in.

If you choose to enter your password, you may be prompted to enter a Two Factor
code or to use your security key to confirm the login.

## How do I enable a Passkey?

Go to your [account settings](https://sso.as207960.net/auth/realms/master/account/#/security/signingin)
to configure Passkeys. Click "Set up Security Key" under "Passwordless", and 
follow your device's instructions to set up your Passkey.

## What's the difference between a Passkey and a Security Key?

If you setup your Security Key as a Passkey under "Passwordless" in your account
then you won't need to enter a password to sign in. If you setup your Security Key
under "Two-factor Authentication" then you'll need to enter your password and then
use your Security Key to sign in.

You also have the option to use TOTP codes (Time-based One Time Password) as a second factor
in addition to your Security Key.

## I created my account before Passkeys were available, how do I remove my password?

If you created your account before Passkeys were available, you can remove your password
by [filling a support ticket](https://support.as207960.net/new/) after
setting up a Passkey. We'll remove your password after going through the implications.
