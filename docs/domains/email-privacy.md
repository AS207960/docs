# WHOIS Email Privacy

When setting up contacts in the domain management panel you have the option to select 
"Disclose email" under the WHOIS disclosure. If you select this your original email will be
published in the public WHOIS record.

If you do not select it we will generate an anonymous `@owowhosth.is` email and publish that instead.
This is to allow you to be contacted in case of problems with your domain or in cases of transfer
authorisation.

All emails sent to your `@owowhosth.is` email will be forwarded to the email address you've provided
us with a prefix of `[AS207960 Domain Privacy]` added to the subject line.

This service is free and available for everyone to use.

Your other personal information (such as name and address) will show simply as `REDACTED`,
unless you have also given us permission to disclose those in WHOIS.
