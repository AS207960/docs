The first year of domain registrations ending in `.co.uk`, `.org.uk`, `.me.uk` or `.uk` will be discounted to &pound;2.50 (at 20% GB VAT).

Prices will vary slightly depending on your location if you are outside the UK as different VAT rates will apply.

## What about renewals?
Renewals during the promotional period, and any renewals on domains registered during the promotional period will be charged at the standard rate.

## What about longer registration periods?
Only the first year of registration will be discounted. A 3 year registration will be charged at &pound;2.50 for the first year, plus 2 times the standard yearly rate for the following two years.
