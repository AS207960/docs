# Domains overview

The domain control panel can be accessed at [domains.glau.ca](https://domains.glauca.digital)

## Pricing
Base pricing information is available [here](https://domains.glauca.digital/prices/), 
however a registry may, at its own discretion, define a domain as premium and increase
the charge for us to register it, and therefore the price you will pay. We'll make you
aware of any such price when you attempt to register such a domain.

## Restore domain?

Restoring a domain is the process of reclaiming a domain after it has expired without renewal,
or after accidental deletion. Unfortunately the registries charge quite a bit for this
(without any real reason to do so), so we have to pass this cost onwards to you.
